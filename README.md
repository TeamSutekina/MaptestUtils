# MaptestUtils
Helpful utilities for playtesting maps

# Usage
## Start a new test
`starttest <username> <world>`
Clones a world and send the user to it.
## End a test
`endtest <username>`
Deletes the world the test is taking place in.

# Why?
I found myself, every time someone joined to playtest, having to clone the world and send them there myself, which was a 4 seconds task, which is way too long! So instead, I dedicated 2 hours to writing this instead, so I no longer have to run two commands myself.
It will probably be helpful when more people are hosting the playtesting sessions and not just me, though.
